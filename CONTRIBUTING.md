# Contributing

You need to install Node.js and Yarn, then run `yarn install` to install the project dependencies. The source files are in the `src` folder, and they are authored as native ESM.

Any kind of contributing is welcome (typos, docs, bug fixes, new features, etc). However, please first open an issue for code-related contributions!
